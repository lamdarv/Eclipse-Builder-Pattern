A small plug-in that helps you create not only getters and setters, but fluent methods, too. Works very similar (and is actually based on) the getter / setter dialog in the Eclipse JDT.

We call these methods "builder pattern" at work, because [Builders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern) where the first classes that used these methods.
